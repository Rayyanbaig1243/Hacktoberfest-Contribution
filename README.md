This repository is for anyone around the globe who wants to start their open-source journey with Hacktoberfest. The purpose of this repository is to learn and share knowledge.

We do not recommend adding just a white-space or Hello World application. Please try to keep your contribution good, as we believe in Quality, and not Quantity. We'll thoroughly go through each PR, and if it doesn't have quality, it won't be accepted.

## Prerequisite

### Git & Github
Here, we have mentioned the instructions to set up git. If you don't already know what Git is, check out this blog series on [iRead](https://iread.ga/series/1/git-and-github).

- Login / Sign-up to [Github](https://github.com/login).
- Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Configure git
    - Launch terminal or command promt.
    - Run the commands.
        - `git config --global user.name "Your name"`
        - `git config --global user.email "Your email address"` 
 - Optionally, you can [setup ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to authenticate easily. 

### What to Contribute

You are free to select any topic such as Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Web Development, etc. Your contribution can be **your mini-project**, **algorithms**, **solution to coding problem**, etc. Just make sure to follow the below guidelines strictly.

## How to contribute?

Refer to [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Learn-Write-Repeat/Hacktoberfest-Contribution/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to setup the repository.

Once you are ready with the setup, follow the below guidelines:

1. Create a folder inside contributions folder with the Topic Name in snake case, i.e., if your topic is URL Shortener using Flask, the folder name should be **url_shortener_using_flask**.

2. Create a markdown file called README.md inside the folder and describe your topic. The description can be **Problem statement of your code**, **Algorithm description**, or something that is relevant to your code.

3. Also, add screenshots, or codes, or Jupyter notebooks inside the same folder.

4. After adding these files, you need to [add yourself as contributor](#add-yourself-as-contributor).


### Add Yourself as Contributor

1. Go to `resources/contributors.json` file, where you will find other contributor details as:
```json
{
    "contributors": [
        {
            "name": "Ashutosh Krishna",
            "github_username": "ashutoshkrris",
            "image_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47353498?v=4",
            "title": "Python API Tutorial",
            "short_description": "In this Python API tutorial, we’ll learn how to retrieve data using requests library. There are millions of APIs online which provide access to data.",
            "page_url": "https://contribute.devincept.com/Hacktoberfest-Contribution/contributions/python-api-tutorial/",
            "folder_url":"https://github.com/Learn-Write-Repeat/Hacktoberfest-Contribution/tree/master/contributions/python-api-tutorial"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Within the contributors array, add your details in the form of map/dictionary as : 
```json
{
    "contributors":[
        {
            "name": "Ashutosh Krishna",
            "github_username": "ashutoshkrris",
            "image_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47353498?v=4",
            "title": "Python API Tutorial",
            "short_description": "In this Python API tutorial, we’ll learn how to retrieve data using requests library. There are millions of APIs online which provide access to data.",
            "page_url": "https://contribute.devincept.com/Hacktoberfest-Contribution/contributions/python-api-tutorial/",
            "folder_url":"https://github.com/Learn-Write-Repeat/Hacktoberfest-Contribution/tree/master/contributions/python-api-tutorial"
        },
        {
            "name": "Rayyan Baig",
            "github_username": "Rayyanbaig1243",
            "image_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137826567?s=400&u=f6327df3b98541d6d6a446762c499c3b702bb209&v=4",
            "title": "PYTHON",
            "short_description": "In this Python tutorial, we’ll learn how to retrieve data using requests library. There are millions of APIs online which provide access to data",
            "page_url": "https://contribute.devincept.com/Hacktoberfest-Contribution/contributions/<your-folder-name>/",
            "folder_url":"https://github.com/Learn-Write-Repeat/Hacktoberfest-Contribution/tree/master/contributions/<your-folder-name>/"
        }
    ]
}
```

> **Note : For the `folder_url` and `page_url`, just replace `<your-folder-name>` with the name of your folder.**
